# Little Interactive Plant Blog

This is a simple static website that shows some basic blog-esque posts about
three of the plants I own. I coded this almost entirely with ChatGPT 4, and also
used GPT to generate images and copy for the website.

I made this site as a warmup for the Web-App project in the JavaScript and
OpenAI API's class, taught by Justin Bakse in Spring 2024.
